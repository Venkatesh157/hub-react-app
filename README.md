# Getting Started with Hub React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App] with Typescript template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

## App Implementation

    - Setup repo using `create-react-app` with typescript template
    - View the API response in Postman and also in app
    - Since, I got CORS error, I setup proxy to overcome CORS
    - Then, I created Card Component to display the data mentioned in tech documentation
    - Created Filter Component, and components like input, select, and checkbox
    - Setup Redux to handle state of selected items, events efficiently to avoid prop drilling and clean code
    - Code refractor and move repeated code to utils
    - Add CSS modules to make the app responsive
    - Write unit tests to ensure the quality of application
    - Final Check and Minor changes
